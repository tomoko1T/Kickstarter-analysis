# Analysis of Kickstarter campaign: how we can win in this campaign!

## Overview of Project

The campaign of Louise's play Fever has been meeting its fundraising goal in a short period of time.  This analysis was conducted using the datasets of the campaign's launch dates and their funding goal amoount to lead other fundraising camplaigns to the successful outcome as well. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to present the relationship of theater outcome and the campaign's launch dates, and the number of outcome and the funding goals amount by collecting the data from the campaign of theater/plays. This analysis was conducted to lead the other campaigns to the successsul outcome in the short period of time.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data of launch dates was extracted to see in which month was a good month to start for Louise’s play Fever campaign to be successful.  The month of May and June were good months to start the fundraising campaign for theater.  The number starts decreasing toward the end of year.  The outcomes trend of both successful and failed are similar, and their up and down movements are pararell each other.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Secondly, the outcomes of successful, failed and canceled were counted in each goal amount range.  The goal range from $1,000 to $4,000 has the highest number for success in this campaign follow by the range of less than $1,000.  Interestingly, the goal amount is not necessary to be set at the lowest amount for the campaign success.  It is obvious that the higher amount the goal amount is set, the lower the successful number becomes as well as the failed number.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were not any challenges encountered in this analysis, however the limitation is that the outcomes are based on the data from only theater/plays, thus it is uncertain whether the result can be applied to other categories’ campaigns to promote their success as theater/plays.       

## Results

As mentioned above, the month of May and June are good months to launch the campaign.  This result may tell people might be exited for the events in summer season as opposed to the end of year.
In regards to the outcomes based on goals, the range from $1,000 to $4,999 is a realistic range to achieve the fundfaising goal in a short period of time.
This analysis is conducted by collecting the dataset of only theater/plays, so the outcomes may not be applied to other categories' campaigns.  Further analysis is recommended to collect the dataset from other categories.
Some other possible options to view this data would be a pie chart for theater outcomes based on launch date, and a bar graph for outcomes based on goal.
